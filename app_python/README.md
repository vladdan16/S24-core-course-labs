# Current Moscow Time - FastAPI Web Application

This is a simple Python web application developed using FastAPI. The application displays the current Moscow time in the browser and updates continuously.

The app also collect usage statistics. It stores number of requests. They can be acquired via /visits route.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.6+
- pip

### Installation & Usage

Clone the repository to your machine

```shell
git clone git@github.com:vladdan16/S24-core-course-labs.git
```

Navigate into the project directory

```
cd S24-core-course-labs/app_python
```

Install the required modules

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server

```shell
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ to see the current time in Moscow. 


## Unit Tests

This project also contains unit tests, that allow us to keep code maintainable.


To run the tests type the following command:

```shell
pytest
```

## Docker

It is also possible to run this application with Docker

To build this app you should have docker installed and running on your machine:

```shell
cd app_python
docker build -t vladdan16/app_python .
```

There is also a depoyed image on Docker Hub. You can pull it with command:

```shell
docker pull vladdan16/app_python
```

To run container:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8000 vladdan16/app_python
```

Now you should be able to access application at `http://localhost:8080`

## CI

In this project I have a CI workflow that run Linter and tests. It is also uses Synk for security check and
builds and pushes Docker image to DockerHub.
